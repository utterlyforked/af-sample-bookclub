# Agentic Development Framework

**Software development in the LLM era: From idea to production with agent-driven planning and implementation.**

## What This Is

A template repository that orchestrates LLM agents to:
1. **Plan** your application (PRD → refinement → specs)
2. **Implement** your application (specs → code)
3. **Evolve** your application (new features, breaking changes)

All artifacts live in Git. All workflows are automated. Humans review and approve at key gates.

## Quick Start

### 1. Use This Template

```bash
# Create your app from this template
gh repo create my-org/my-app --template my-org/agentic-framework --private

cd my-app
```

### 2. Configure Secrets

In GitHub Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, add:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
ORCHESTRATOR_PAT=your-github-pat-here
```

### 3. Initialize Your Project

```bash
# Initialize with your app idea
cp docs/00-user-idea.md.tmpl docs/00-user-idea.md
```

Modify the the user-idea with a basic summary of what you want to build and commit it.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initialize project"
git push
```

### 4. Watch It Run

The orchestrator will automatically:
- Run Product Manager agent → creates PRD
- If you're happy with the summary of what should be built create a '.approved' file in the docs/01-prd directory and commit
- The product owner agent will break it down to features and work with the  Tech Lead agent to refine it
- Loop until features are refined
- If you're happy with the summary of the feature breakdown and refinement create a '.approved' file in the docs/03-refinement directory and commit
- The Foundation Architect → analyzes common elements and identifies a spec-0 for all common functionality
- The Security Agent and QA agent will then asses the overall project
- The Engineering Spec agent → creates implementation specs

Check the Actions tab in GitHub to watch progress.

## What You'll Get

After the workflow completes:

```
my-app/
├── docs/
│   ├── .state/                  # Orchestration state
│   ├── 01-prd/                  # High level requirements
│   ├── 02-features/             # Broken Down Features
│   ├── 03-refinement/           # PO/TL iteration questions/answers to refine spec
│   └── 04-foundation/           # Common capabailities/architecture and security and QA assesment with testing approach
│   └── 05-specs/                # Impelentation specifications 
│
└── src/                         # Implemented code
    ├── API/
    ├── Web/
    └── Tests/
```

Everything traced back to decisions in Git history.

## Customization

Before using, customize for your organization:

### Tech Stack

Edit `context/tech-stack-standards.md` to match your preferred:
- Backend framework
- Frontend framework
- Database
- Testing tools
- Deployment platform

### Agent Prompts

Optionally customize agent behaviors in `agents/*/prompt.md`:
- Product Manager tone
- Tech Lead question style
- Engineering Spec detail level
- QA 
- APP Sec

## How It Works

See [INTRODUCTION.md](./INTRODUCTION.md) for the full story.

**Short version:**

1. **State machine** (`docs/.state/*.json`) tracks what needs to happen
2. **Orchestrator** (`scripts/orchestrate.py`) finds next task and runs it
3. **Agents** (`agents/*/`) generate artifacts (PRD, questions, specs, code)
4. **Judges** (`agents/judge-*/`) validate quality before human review
5. **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/`) automates it all

Humans review at strategic decision points. Agents handle iteration and implementation.

## Requirements

- GitHub repository
- Anthropic API key (for Claude)
- Python 3.9+
- Git

**The bet:** Planning and implementation should both be agent-driven, version-controlled, and traceable. This framework is one way to explore that future.
